Welcome to my digital garden! My name is LJT, and I am the creator of this space. 

This digital garden is a place for me to collect and organize my thoughts, ideas, and resources on a wide variety of topics. It is a place for me to explore and grow my knowledge over time.

I believe that the process of creating and maintaining a digital garden can be a fun and rewarding experience. It allows me to connect with others who share similar interests, and it gives me a way to reflect on my learning and growth.

Some of the topics that I cover in my digital garden include:

* Personal development
* Creativity and art
* Productivity and time management
* Technology and programming
* Natural history and the environment
* I hope you enjoy exploring my digital garden! If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to contact me.

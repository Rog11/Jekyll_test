# Nutrition

Nutrition is defined as the science of food, involving the sum total of the processes involved in the intake and utilization of food substances by living organisms, including ingestion, digestion, absorption, transport, and metabolism of nutrients found in food. 

A nutrient is a specific susbtance found in food that performs one or more physiological or biochemical functions in the body. There are six major classes of essential nutrients found in foods: Carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, minerals,and water. 

Essential nutreitns perform three basic functions
* Provide energy for human metabolism. Carbs and fats are the prime sources of energy. Protein may also provide, but this is not its major function. Vitamin, minerals and water are not energy sources. 
* Use to promote growth and development by building and repairing body tissue. Protein is the major building material for muscles, other soft tissues, and enzymes, while certain minerals such as calcium and phosphorus make up the skeletal framework. 
* Regulate and maintain diverse physiological processes of human metabolism. 


In order for our bodies to function effectively, we need more
than 40 specific essential nutrients, and we need these nutrients in
various amounts as recommended by nutrition scientists. Dietary
Reference Intakes (DRI) represent the current recommendations in the United States and include the Recommended Dietary
Allowances (RDA). Nutrient deficiencies or excesses may cause various health problems, some very serious.

# Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI)

The Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) include two sets of
nutrient intake goals for individuals—the Recommended
Dietary Allowance (RDA) and Adequate Intake (AI). The RDA
reflects the average daily amount of a nutrient considered
adequate to meet the needs of most healthy people. If there
is insufficient evidence to determine an RDA, an AI is set.
In addition, the Estimated Energy Requirement (EER) represents the average dietary energy intake considered adequate
to maintain energy balance in healthy people.

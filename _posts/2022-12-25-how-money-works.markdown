# How money works 

## Adam Smith 

* Market equilibrium: When the amount of certai goods demanded by buyers matches the amount supplied by sellers- the point at which all parties are satisfied with a good's price. 
* Laissez-faire: an economic theory that holds that the market will produce the best solutions in the absense of government interference. Trade, prices, and wages do not need to be regulated, as the market itself will correct imbalances in them. 
* Comparative Advantage: The idea that countries should
specialize in those goods they can produce at the lowest cost.
By avoiding producing goods in which they do not have a comparative advantage, countries will become more efficient and therefore better off.

## Theories and money

* Keynes' general theory: In his 1935 book General Theory, John Maynard Keynes argued that government spending and taxation levels affect prices more than the quantity of money in the economy. He proposed that in times of recession a government should increase spending to encourage employment, and reduce taxes to stimulate the economy.
* Fisher's quantity theory:  There is a direct link between the amount of money in the economy and price level, with more money in circulation increasing prices. 
* Marx's labor theory of value: The German economist Karl Marx argued that the real price (or economic value) of goods should be determined not by the demand for those goods, but by the value of the labor that went into producing it.
* Hayek's business cycle: Austrian economist Friedrich Hayek noted a cycle in the economy, in which interest rates fall during a recession. This leads to an overexpansion of credit, necessitating a rise in interest rates to counter excess demand.
* Friedman's monetarism: Milton Friedman argued that governments could raise or lower interest rates to affect the money supply. Cuts would stimulate consumer spending; rises would restrict it and reduce the amount of money in the supply. 


## Corporate Accounting
* Cash flow: This indicates how much income a business is generating, and how this compares to its costs and the expenses that it has to pay out. A company is said to have a positive cashflow if its income exceeds its expenses.
* Smoothing earnings: This business practice, aimed at reducing volatility in income and reported profit, uses accounting techniques to limit fluctuations in company earnings.
* Net income: This is the income that a company reports at the end of the financial year after costs
and expenses have been deducted. It is calculated by
starting with the revenue earned and then taking away
the cost of tax, expenses, banking and interest charges,
depreciation of assets, staff costs, and any other expenses
involved in operating the business. 
* Gearing Ratio: Capital gearing is the balance between a company's capital (available money or assets) and its funding by short-or-long-term loans, expressed as a percentage.  company with relatively low gearing is regarded as being less risky and in a better position to cope with an economic downturn.

### net income 
* bottom line: refers to the bottom of the income statement, and is another expression for net income. 
* earnings per share: Net income divided by the number of shares in issue; it is seen as an indicator of a company's profitability. 
* expenses: cost of running a business that have to be settled immediately. 
* Depreciation of assets: The decline in value of assets that the company has bought; may be a plant for manufacturing or machines 
* banking and interest charges: cost of finance, loans, debts and mortages and other owing. 

## Expensing vs Capitalizing
When a business incurs a cost it needs to record it in its
company accounts. The company can do this for the full amount
at the time it happens, or spread the cost over several years.

Capitalizing and expensing in practice: All companies have costs and expenses. Some such as electricity and other utilities, insurance, staff wages, and food need to be paid for upfront, so these are expensed. To qualify as
capital expenditure, an asset must be useful for more than one year. Businesses have to decide which option best fits their business model. A ski resort buys a new ski lift, snowplow, and bus, as well as some furniture, and capitalizes the cost.

Capitalize: For businesses wanting to have a smoother flow of reported income and for start-up businesses, it can be attractive to capitalize purchases because by keeping costs down, a business can report a higher income in its early years. However, there are tax implications if it is making a larger profit as a result.

Expense: If a firm expenses some of its costs, its profitability may be lower. This may be useful in order to reduce tax; lower profits mean lower taxation. A company may also choose to expense a cost if it has had a good year and wants to show high profitability in later years. Some costs, such as staff payments, must be expensed.

## Cash flow 
* factor: third party which, for a commission, collects payment from a business's customers. 
* accounts payable: payments a business has to make to others
* accounts receivable: payments a business is due to receive. 
* aging schedule: a table charting accounts payable and accounts receivable according to their dates. 
* cacsh flow gap: The interval between when payments are made and when they are recieved. 
* cash conversion: successful businesses convert their product or service into cash inflows before their bills are due. 
* operating cash flow: inflows nad outflows relating to a company's day-to-day activity

## Gearing Ratio and Risk 

Gearing ratio calculation

Long-term debt/Share capital+reserves+long-term debt x 100. 

< 25 is considered *low gearing*


## Financial Instruments
* Shares: Companies issue shares to investors in return for money. A legal agreement between a company and a shareholder might include the payment of dividends (when and if the company can afford to do so), or perks for as long as the investor holds the shares.
* Options and derivatives: The value of derivatives depends on the performance of an underlying asset. They are traded to provide capital growth, or to limit risk within a business or a portfolio. Professional investors may use them to hedge their portfolios.
* Bonds and loans: These are IOUs between a company and an investor. The investor effectively loans a company or government money and, in return, the borrower pays interest to the investor over a set period, at a set rate, with a specified date for the return of the capital. 
* Funds: An investment fund (such as an ETF fund) is a supply of capital belonging to a group of investors. This money is invested by the fund in the hope that the fund’s share price will increase, netting the investors a capital gain. It may also pay interest.
* Currencices: Different currencies can be held and traded by investors to exploit movements in exchange rates for profit.
* Insurance: An insurance policy involves a company or individual paying a premium to an insurance company, entering into a contract that promises monetary compensation in the event of them suffering a pre-agreed loss scenario.

## Bonds
Companies and governments sell bonds to raise money without issuing shares. They are effectively fixed-term loans bought by investors who receive interest until the end of that term. 

Bonds are securities for long-term debt, although they are not always held until the end of their term. The price of a bond rises and falls depending on current interest rates, and on how likely investors feel thebond issuer is to repay the initial sum invested. There are different kinds of bonds such as savings bonds, company bonds, and government bonds (also known as US treasury securities), and some can be traded between investors. In savings bonds, investors deposit a lump sum with a retail savings institution (such as a bank), receive regular interest, and are repaid the original sum in full. In other types of bonds, repayment of the original sum is not guaranteed, since the issuer could go bust. Because the risk of government default is so small, gilts are seen as the least risky bond type.

* Face value: initial price at which the bond was issued
* Market or par value: the price at which a bond is traded. 
* Coupon: the amount of interest paid to bond investors. 
* Yield: A general term that relates to the return on the capital invested in a bond. 
* Savings bonds: cash deposits on which a regular interest rate is paid. 
* Securities: Financial instruments, such as bonds, that can be traded. 
* Junk bonds: bonds of highly risky companies 
* Default: when a company fails to honor a repayment on a bond that has sold to an investor. 

Yield Calculation
Coupon amount/bond price * 100/1 = yield % 


## Derivatives
A type of financial instrument, the value of derivatives is based on the price of an underlying asset or index. They are commonly used by investors to spread risk, and/or to speculate. 

## Money Markets
* Treasury bills: short term government securities that mature within three months to one year of issue, also known as t-bills. They are acquired at a discount on their face or "par" value, which is then paid in full on maturity. T-bills are considered effectively risk-free 
* Certificate of Deposit: Fixed-term savings certificates issued with a set interest rate by banks. Rates depends on lenght of maturity, with longer temrs getting better rates. The mains risks are being locked into low interest rates if rates rise, and early withdrawal penalties. 
* Bank deposits: Money deposited in banks, often for a fixd term. Interest rates vary, based on the amount of deposited and on deposit liquidity. Risk depends on bank creditworthiness, and whther it is insured by the FDIC. 
* Commercial Paper: short term, unsecured debt issued by a company. Only companies with good credit ratings issue commercial paper because investors are reluctant to buy the debt of financially compromised companies. They tend to be issued by highly rated banks and are traded in a similar way to securities. Asset values are in the thousands or millions of dollars.
* Federal funds rate: The rate at which financial institutions borrow and lend to each other overnight. It is a very influential interest rate in the US economy - if the rates goes up, so does the cost of borrowing. 


## Forex
* curency pair: two currencies being traded
* spread: the difference betwn the price at which one of a currency pair is sold, and the price at which it can be bought; spreads change depending on the liquidity of the markets and the demand or the currencies being traded. 
* Leverage: The option for individuals to trade higher values of currency than the cash in their forex account would cover.
* stop loss: An order placed with a broker to sell currency once it reaches a certain price, to limit the losses investors experience when the market moves against them.
* margin call: a request from a forex broker fro an investor to ncrease their deposit, as the value of their investment has fallen below a certain point. 

## Primary and secondary markets 

Primary market: A private company may decide to issue shares because it needs money to expand and grow, and it wants access to a wide pool of potential investors.The company sells (or “floats”) these new shares in the primary market in an Initial Public Offering (IPO). A company that is preparing to float will use the services of several investment banks to gauge and gather support for the sale of its shares from institutional and private investors before setting a price. The shares are then sold to the public and institutional investors by the company using the services of a specialty broke

Company: the public and investors can buy shares of a public company in the primary market. 

Secondary Market: When investors talk about shares being bought and sold, they are usually talking about transactions taking place in the secondary market. This is where shares are traded between investors. Trading is facilitated by brokers or dealers who take commission on trades. Dealers also earn profit on the spread, or difference, between the price at which they buy and sell shares. These dealers are known as market makers and maintain liquidity by offering a buy and sell price at which they will accept trades. The secondary market includes the London Stock Exchange, New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq, and other stock exchanges in countries around the world.

third and fourth markets: institutional investors such as pension funds or hedge funds tend to trade stocks and shares in significant volumes. The third and fourth markets cater to these high-volume trades. The third market operates between large investors and broker-dealers. The fourth market caters to large investors who buy and sell shares to each other. The cost of trades tend to be lower than in primary and secondary markets because there ar eno brokers' commissions. Although the stock may be listed on the main stock exchanges, the trades that take place are not put through them, and large trades can be made anonymously. 

## Predicting market changes

* fundamental analysis: An assessment of revenues, costs, debt, profit margins, and management.
* technical analysis: Research aimed at identifying patterns that indicate if a share is trending up or down.
* Hedging A strategy that involves investors buying shares they think are likely to rise in price while also selling shares they think will fall, in order to maintain a market-neutral position.

## Arbitrage

Arbitrage is the practice of buying a tradeable asset in one market and almost simultaneously selling it at a higher price in a different market. Conversely, it is also the practice of selling an asset in one market and buying it for a cheaper price in another. Arbitrage, as currently practiced in stock and bond markets, is only possible due to the computing power now available, so large volumes of transactions can exploit small differences in prices within milliseconds.


* High frequency traders (HFT): Computing power enables HFT to search the markets for tiny anomalies to exploit. A computer program automatically evaluates and carries out a large number of trades at high speeds—faster than any person could do. It is possible to make a lot of money from very small price differences in this way.


## Day trading 

Day trading is the buying and selling of shares, currency, or other financial instruments in a single day. The intention is to profit from small price fluctuations—sometimes traders hold shares for only a few minutes.


## Nonbank financial institutions (NBFI)

* commercial loan providers 
* peer to peer lenders
* crowdfunding
* credit unions
* specialty lenders
* savings and loans associations
* pawnbrokers

# Money Supply 

Types of money in an economy are classfied in "M" groups. The most liquid, or spendable, form of money is called "narrow" money, and include M0 and M1. The definition of “broad money” includes other less liquid, less convertible forms. These are classed as M2, M3, and also M4.

## Increasing money circulation

Most of the money in the economy occurs in the form of bank
deposits—the appearance of funds in bank accounts. Banks
increase money circulation whenever they make loans.

## Banking Reserves 

The central bank sets the reserve requirement for commercial banks. This is the minimum percentage of total deposits that banks must hold as actual currency, in case some depositors wish to withdraw deposits as cash. Reserve amounts of hard currency may be stored in bank vaults on site, or held by the central bank in the form of deposits. The reserve amount held by a bank is usually around 10 percent of its total deposits. The remaining 90 percent of deposits, the excess reserve, can be loaned out to other customers. Freeing up capital for loans helps to create wealth in the Banking reserves economy. However, it also means that commercial banks would be unable to honor all withdrawals should all of its depositors try to withdraw their money as cash at the same time. This is a scenario that commercial banks count on as very unlikely; however, in such an event, they can appeal to the central bank for additional reserves. The central bank manipulates the reserve rate to influence how much money commercial banks are able to loan. In theory, a low reserve rate makes it cheaper for banks to lend, and vice versa.


## Recession and the money supply 

The way money is used in an economy will change depending on how well or badly that economy is performing. In a recession, the money supply is restricted, which affects the whole economy.

Recessionary cycle: Everything in the economy is linked to everything else through buying and selling, so it is possible for an economic downturn to lead to an ongoing pattern of decline—known as a recessionary cycle. Once a few households or firms (or the government) begin to cut their spending, other firms will start to sell less. In turn, they will want to reduce the amount they are spending on labor, or raw materials, to limit the impact of falling sales. They may also put off making longer-term investment decisions as profits are uncertain, meaning that they contribute even less money to the economy. This can add up to a powerful negative cycle.

* Expansionary policy: Attempts by a government to make an economy grow faster—for example by cutting taxes, raising government spending, cutting interest rates, or making money easier to borrow.
* Contractionary policy: Attempts by a government to slow an economy down, usually to try to avoid inflation—for example by raising taxes, cutting government spending, or both. It usually involves raising interest rates and making money harder to borrow.

## Government and Money 

A healthy economy requires a good money supply. Although it is difficult to control the supply of money directly, government monetary policy can help to influence it. The most important institution in monetary policy is the central bank (see pp.100−103), which is critical in determining interest rates and can be used to inject more money into the economy via open market operations or through quantitative easing. Governments may also control the flow of money via taxes and other capital controls, and by restricting borrowing and lending. However, these mechanisms are imperfect in the modern monetary system, since commercial banks are largely free to decide the terms of their lending. Attempts to directly control money supply tend to fail.

## Central Bank 

A central bank manages a country’s currency, money supply, and interest rates, and holds central bank reserves. Commercial banks rely on these central bank reserves to support their day-to-day operations. By altering the amount of the reserves, and the cost of borrowing from them (via the rate of interest, known as the reserve rate or base rate), central banks can assert control over the country’s money supply.
The base rate is usually the cheapest rate of interest available for its currency, and because central bank reserves are fundamental to commercial banks’ ability to lend, the central bank helps to set interest rates for the entire economy. When the reserve rate rises or falls, interest rates on commercial bank loans do the same. As with the supply and demand of other commodities, when demand for reserve money is high, its price (here the reserve rate or base rate) rises. Conversely, when the demand for reserve money is low, its price falls. Central banks often focus on regulating other specific economic targets—most typically the rate of inflation. They do this by meeting preset, publicly displayed targets.

* Reserve rate: the interest rate set by the central bank that all commercial banks must pay to borrow central bank reserves. It is also known as the base rate.
* Inflation targeting: A central bank monetary policy in which a specific target inflation rate is set and made public, with the intention of stabilizing prices.

## Budget Contraint
Governments have financial constraints just as individuals and
companies do. When spending exceeds income, the government
may need to borrow—or even print—money to cover the shortfall.


*The difference btween a government tax revenues and its spending is known as its budget (or fiscal) deficit. The budget deficit shows how much extra money the government needs to borrow (or print) to finance its spending.* 

![5](/howMoneyW/5.PNG) 


![6](/howMoneyW/6.PNG) 


## Government Borrowing
Government borrowing is the main way that governments pay for any spending that is not already covered by taxation. However, excessive borrowing will result in high levels of government debt.



Governments typically borrow money by issuing bonds to individuals and financial institutions in exchange for a loan. The government will then pay a fixed rate of interest over a period of time to the investor, paying the bond back in full when it reaches maturity. 

## Public Debt  
Public debt is the total amount of money owed by a country’s government, and includes historic debt. Nations with big economies and large tax-paying populations can carry more debt than those without.

## Economic indicators 

* Inflation: nflation is typically defined according to the percentage increase in price of a “basket of goods,” which is selected by looking at what products people typically buy over a year.
* Growth: measured by the growth of “Gross Domestic Product.” GDP is the total value of all of the goods and services produced by a country in one year.
* Unemployment: This is the proportion of those who could work and who want to work, but are not currently employed. It is measured as a percentage and varies widely across different countries.
* Wages: Overviews of wages are usually shown as a growth figure. As prices rise due to inflation, wages must rise even faster in order to ensure that living standards are improving.

## Deciding on economic policy 

Economic policy making has been compared to trying to operate a finely balanced machine. By adjusting various policy “dials," the government aims for the best combination of key economic variables—usually, a combination of low inflation and unemployment levels. However, economists point to a trade-off between inflation and unemployment, with low unemployment coming at the cost of high inflation, and vice versa. More recently, economists have concluded that economies run best by themselves, with limited intervention.

* Inflation: With high inflation and low unemployment, the government raises taxes to reduce money in the system and reduce inflation. 
* Unemployment: Less money in circulation means lower inflation but also encourages lay-offs, and unemployment rises.
* Employment: To reduce unemployment, the government increases spending in areas such as infrastructure to increase the number of construction jobs. 

* Inflation is the one form of taxation that can be imposd without legislation - Milton Friedman

## Interest Rates
Interest is effectively the price charged by a lender to a borrower for
the use of funds. The national reserve interest rate, set by the central
bank, affects how easy it is to borrow or lend money in a country.


* Nomina Rate: an advertised interest rate, whihc does not factor in the effect of inflation (or fees, or the effect of compoud interest)
* real rate: Of particular interest to investors, this rate takes inflation into account and is calculated by subtracting the inflation rate from the nominal rate.

Inflation is the decline of a currency's purchasing power due to an oversupply of money. A limited supply of goods and services, along with an oversupply of money, means that money devalues and more of it is required to obtain producuts. A loan is a product and the interest rate the price paid for it,  so if the  value of
money decreases, then commercial banks may charge a higher interest rate on their loans. Higher charges will make borrowing more expensive, resulting in fewer loans being taken out. This may ultimately impact spending, causing the money supply to fall, as well as the rate of inflation.


## Quantitative Easing

Quantitative easing is a 21st-century strategy aimed at boosting the economy. It uses central bank’s powers to create new money in 
an effort to reduce interest rates and increase investment and spending. 


Quantitative easing (QE) has been used when economic activity is sluggish and there is afear of deflation or recession. QE involves the creation of new money—usually in the form of electronic currency—which the central bank then uses to buy government bonds or bonds from investors such as banks or pension funds. The aim is to increasethe liquidity of money in the economy which will in turn lower interest rates and make lending easier and more attractive. This, in turn, should encourage businesses to invest and consumers to spend more, thus boosting the economy.

QE is still very much a monetary policy experiment in progress. There are concerns that it could lead to an inflation problem, and its detractors point out that its benefits are felt only in selected sectors of the economy.

## Level of Taxation
It is difficult for governments to establish how much tax to levy. Too low, and the government cannot provide the services people want.Too high, and people will be unwilling to pay the tax.

Governments can impose  taxes on a person’s earnings, their buildings and homes, savings and investments, pensions, inherited property, or on what they spend. Most governments rely heavily on income taxes, usually with different proportionate levels for different levels of earnings. This makes the tax system fairer, but introducing more complexity also increases thechances of tax avoidance. However, some taxes are levied in order to change behavior. By taxing something viewed as bad, such as tobacco or alcohol, the government can help to persuade people to consume less of those things.

Pigouvian Taxes: Standard economic theory says that if consuming a good or service causes harm, a tax should be applied to it until the value of the tax matches the cost of the harm done. As shownto the right, a government could impose a tax on sugar to match the cost to public health services of obesity. In the US, some states tax sugary drinks, but the percentage varies.


* Effective tax rate: Many tax systems allow different “reliefs”—such as investment relief to encourage investment. More than one tax may also be levied at once, for example income and corporation tax. As a result, the effective (average) tax rate may differ from the headline (basic) rate.
* Marginal tax rate: Describes the additional tax paid from undertaking a small amount of extra activity—for example the extra tax paid in earning $1 more. Decisions  made “at the margin” influence the behavior of individuals and businesses, such as whether it is worth working longer hours.
* Gray economy: people who wokr for cash wages and do not declare their income, in order to avoid paying tax. 

*The laffer curve*: The Laffer curve, named after US economist Arthur Laffer, illustrates the idea that there is an optimum level of taxation to maximize revenues. This is because at very high rates of taxation, more people will be looking to avoid or reduce the tax than will pay it. So, although tax revenues initially increase with rising tax rates, eventually they will decline. Controversy surrounds the idea because it is very hard to know where this optimum point might be and also because it would seem to legitimize non-payment of taxes by high net-worth individuals, and tax avoidance by ordinary people who start to participate in the “gray economy.


## government spending 
The size of a government’s budget, relative to its economy, can vary. Typically, governments spend around 40 percent of GDP. 


## Balance of payments (BOP)
In theory, a country’s BOP should total zero, as each credit to the current account will correspond with a debit to the capital account, and vice versa. Realistically, as a result of variations in accounting practices and exchange rate fluctuations, this rarely happens.

## International currency fluctiations
Reserve currency is a recognized safe foreign currency held by a country’s central bank and financial institutions and used to make trade payments. Using the reserve currency avoids the need to change payments into local currency, minimizing the exchange-rate risk for both countries. Many central banks set a reserve ratio—the percentage of domestic currency that the bank must hold. The US dollar is the currency most commonly held in reserves worldwide.


# Personal Finance
* Net worth: Assets - debt 
* Wealth: Wealth is the value of assets already owned by a household or an individual. It can be savings alone if these are sufficient, or it can be amassed from savings, investments, and inheritance. Wealth is rarely used for day-to-day expenses unless income stops.
* Portfolio income: Money earned from interest, dividends or cpaital gains. This is recognized as a separate type of income by tax authorities, such as us
* capital gain: the profit earned from the sale of an asset, such as a house or art, that has gone up in value since it was first bought.
* unearned income: Money from investments, pension funds, alimony, interest, or rental property.

## Investments for income 
* Higher risk: shares; ordinary, preference, futures, options, units in manged share funds 
* Medium risk: property; rental from residentail, commercial, industrial, profit from buying and selling
* Lower risk: intrest-paying: savings account, term deposits, debentures, bonds


* Equities: an alternative term for stocks and shares. 

## Dividents from shares
* Preferred share: share that entitles the holder to a fixed dividend that is prioritized over ordinary share dividends. 
* Dividend cover: how many times over the dividend could be paid out of the company's profit. 

## Investing in managed funds 
Investors in managed funds do not have direct control over what
happens to their money. Instead they rely on an investment
manager to invest on their behalf. 

* Market Index: a statistical measurement reflecting the performance of stocks, shares, and bonds in a single market. 
* Index arbitrage: an investment strategy of profiting from the price difference in buying and selling futures in the same stock index. 
* Index fund: an investment fund consisting of stocks in one particular market index, such as Standard & Poor's 500. 

Indexes to know
* FTSE 100: top 100 UK companies 
* FTSE all-share: all companies on london stock exchange 
* Dow jones: top 30 us companies
* S&P 500: top 500 us companies
* wilshire 5000: total us stocks
* MSCI EAFE: equity markets in 21 european and pacific countries. 


## Rental Income from property
Rental income - landlord expenses/ property cost * 100 = rentail yield. 


## Life assurance
Although the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably, life assurance is different from life insurance. Assurance protects the holder against an inevitable event—their death—while insurance protects against the possibility that their death might happen within a set timeframe—for example, 50 years from the date the policy was purchased. So if a policyholder with 50-year life insurance dies before the term is up, their beneficiaries receive a payout. If, however, they die 51 years after the policy was taken out, there is no payout at all.


In contrast, a life assurance policy will pay out when the policyholder dies, whenever that happens, or provide a lump sum if the holder outlives the policy term.

* Life settlement: The sale of a policyholder’s life insurance policy to a third party for more than its cash value, but less than its net death benefit, providing a lump sum. People may sell a policy because they no longer want it, they wish to purchase a different policy, or they cannot afford the premiums.
* Viatical settlement: This is the same as a life settlement, only the policyholder sells their policy because they have a terminal or life-threatening illness.

## Investing in property 

* appreciation: rise in the value of the property over time.
* depreciation: fall in the value of the property over time.
* capital gain: increase in value of a property (or other asset) from its purchase price; this can be short term or long-term
* BRR: buying, refurbishing and refiniancing strategy. 

## Home equity 
* collateral: property or asset that a lender will take if a borrower fails to pay a loan 
* home equity loan: loan that uses equity in a property as collateral. 
* Equity: property's equity is equal to the current value of the property minus the outstanding loan amount. 


## Managed Funds 
* index funds: These funds aim to match the performance of a particular financial index, such as the FTSE 100. 
* actively managed funds: These aim to deliver higher thanaverage returns. Active managers analyze, research, and forecastmarkets to make investment decisions on which securities to buy and hold, or sell off.
* Absolute return funds These funds aim to deliver consistent
returns regardless of whether the stock market rises or falls

## Dollar cost averaging (DCA) 
Catching the bottom of the market to get the best unit price is difficult, and even the experts get it wrong sometimes. One way for investors to smooth out the market’s highs and lows is to spread or drip-feed money into investments instead of investing it all in one go. This is known as dollar cost averaging. For example, if $100 a month is invested into a fund, the sum of money would buy fewer fund units when the cost is high and more units when the cost is low. The average cost per share over time is the mean of highs and lows. As well as freeing investors from having to second-guess market movements, this approach encourages regular investing each month. Dollar cost averaging can be especially beneficial in a falling market, as the cost per unit is then lower.

## Interest and compound interest 
When money is saved it “earns” interest. Compound interest accrues if the investor reinvests it, as opposed to withdrawing the interest.

* Principal amount: the original capital sum invested or borrowed. 
* Compounding frequency: the number of times that interest is added to the principal amount in one year. For example, if interest is added monthly, the compounding frequency is 12. 
* annual percentage rate (APR): the annual rate of interest payable on mortages, credit cards, etc. It includes the rate as well as fees, such as annual fees. APR can be referred to as the annual equivalent rate (AER), effective interest rate (EIR) or effective annual rate (EAR).

## Mortages
* Fixed rate mortage
* Interst only mortage 
* Adjustable-rate mortage (ARM) 
* reverse mortages 
* islamic mortages: no interest 

Terms 
* LTV: loan to value ratio; percentage of a property's value borrowed as a mortage 
* security: collateral for the loan; morages, the property 
* remortage: a different or additional loan taken out on a property. 
* term: years over which the mortage is repaid
* equity: value of the property over the mortage amount
* negative equity: value of the property being less than the mortage amount.
* Guarantor: person who argees to be responsible for meeting the mortage repayments if the borroower fails to do so. 

# Money in the US 

## Stock exchanges

* Nasdaq composite: the nasdaq composite is an index of the securities listed on the exchange
* S&P 500: The S&P is comprised of the top 500 companies that are
listed on either the NYSE or the Nasdaq. They are the largest companies, based on market capitalization.
* Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) The DJIA includes the 30 largest (and most influential) companies in the US. The companies are considered to have “blue chip” stocks. They are very large corporations with good reputations.. With only 30 companies included in the index, the DJIA isn’t considered an indicator for the entire market. But the companies are considered stable and offer the possibility of dividends as well as less risk for an investor.

# Find the right metric

* metrics often come in pairs
* conversion rate (% of people who buy something) is tied to time-to-purchase
* together they tell you a lot about cash flow 
* similarily viral coefficient (the number of people a user successfully invites to your service) and viral cycle
  time (how long it takes them to invite others) drive your adoption rate.
* behind them lurks a fundamental metric like revenue, cash flow, or user adoption


Qualitative versus quantitative metrics
* Qualitative metrics are unstructured, anecdotal, revealing, and hard
to aggregate; quantitative metrics involve numbers and statistics, and
provide hard numbers but less insight.

## Qualitative vs Quantitative Metrics

Quantitative data is easy to understand. It’s the numbers we track and
measure—for example, sports scores and movie ratings. As soon as
something is ranked, counted, or put on a scale, it’s quantified. Quantitative
data is nice and scientific, and (assuming you do the math right) you can
aggregate it, extrapolate it, and put it into a spreadsheet. But it’s seldom
enough to get a business started. You can’t walk up to people, ask them
what problems they’re facing, and get a quantitative answer. For that, you
need qualitative input.

Qualitative data is messy, subjective, and imprecise. It’s the stuff of interviews
and debates. It’s hard to quantify. You can’t measure qualitative data
easily. If quantitative data answers “what” and “how much,” qualitative
data answers “why.” Quantitative data abhors emotion; qualitative data
marinates in it.

Initially, you’re looking for qualitative data. You’re not measuring results
numerically. Instead, you’re speaking to people—specifically, to people you
think are potential customers in the right target market. You’re exploring.
You’re getting out of the building.

Collecting good qualitative data takes preparation. You need to ask specific
questions without leading potential customers or skewing their answers.
You have to avoid letting your enthusiasm and reality distortion rub off
on your interview subjects. Unprepared interviews yield misleading or
meaningless results.

## Vanity vs Real Metrics

Many companies claim they’re data-driven. Unfortunately, while they
embrace the data part of that mantra, few focus on the second word:
driven. If you have a piece of data on which you cannot act, it’s a vanity
metric. If all it does is stroke your ego, it won’t help. You want your data
to inform, to guide, to improve your business model, to help you decide on
a course of action. 

Whenever you look at a metric, ask yourself, “What will I do differently
based on this information?” If you can’t answer that question, you probably
shouldn’t worry about the metric too much. And if you don’t know which metrics would change your organizations behavior, you aren't being data driven. You're floundering in data quicksand. 

Consider, for example, “total signups.” This is a vanity metric. The number
can only increase over time (a classic “up and to the right” graph). It tells us
nothing about what those users are doing or whether they’re valuable to us.
They may have signed up for the application and vanished forever.

“Total active users” is a bit better—assuming that you’ve done a decent job
of defining an active user—but it’s still a vanity metric. It will gradually
increase over time, too, unless you do something horribly wrong.

The real metric of interest—the actionable one—is “percent of users
who are active.” This is a critical metric because it tells us about the level
of engagement your users have with your product. When you change
something about the product, this metric should change, and if you change
it in a good way, it should go up. That means you can experiment, learn,
and iterate with it.

## 8 vanity metrics to watch out for
1. number of hits
2. number of page views 
3. number of visits
4. number of unique visitors
5. number of followers/friends/likes
6. time on site/number of pages 
7. emails collected 
8. number of downloads

## Exploratory vs Reporting metrics

There are known knowns; there are things we know that we know.
There are known unknowns; that is to say there are things that we
now know we don’t know. But there are also unknown unknowns—
there are things we do not know, we don’t know.

The “known unknowns” is a reporting posture—counting money, or users,
or lines of code. We know we don’t know the value of the metric, so we go
find out. We may use these metrics for accounting (“How many widgets
did we sell today?”) or to measure the outcome of an experiment (“Did the
green or the red widget sell more?”), but in both cases, we know the metric
is needed.

The “unknown unknowns” are most relevant to startups: exploring to
discover something new that will help you disrupt a market. As we’ll see
in the next case study, it’s how Circle of Friends found out that moms were
its best users. These “unknown unknowns” are where the magic lives.
They lead down plenty of wrong paths, and hopefully toward some kind
of “eureka!” moment when the idea falls into place. This fits what Steve
Blank says a startup should spend its time doing: searching for a scalable,
repeatable business model.

Analytics has a role to play in all four of Rumsfeld’s quadrants:
It can check our facts and assumptions—such as open rates or
conversion rates—to be sure we’re not kidding ourselves, and check
that our business plans are accurate.
* It can test our intuitions, turning hypotheses into evidence.
* It can provide the data for our spreadsheets, waterfall charts, and
board meetings.
* It can help us find the nugget of opportunity on which to build a
business.

## Leading vs lagging metrics 

A leading metric (sometimes called a leading indicator) tries to predict the
future. For example, the current number of prospects in your sales funnel
gives you a sense of how many new customers you’ll acquire in the future. If the current number of prospects is very small, you’re not likely to add
many new customers. You can increase the number of prospects and expect
an increase in new customers. 

On the other hand, a lagging metric, such as churn (which is the number
of customers who leave in a given time period) gives you an indication
that there’s a problem—but by the time you’re able to collect the data and
identify the problem, it’s too late. The customers who churned out aren’t
coming back. That doesn’t mean you can’t act on a lagging metric (i.e.,
work to improve churn and then measure it again), but it’s akin to closing
the barn door after the horses have left. New horses won’t leave, but you’ve
already lost a few.

In the early days of your startup, you won’t have enough data to know how
a current metric relates to one down the road, so measure lagging metrics
at first. Lagging metrics are still useful and can provide a solid baseline
of performance. For leading indicators to work, you need to be able to do
cohort analysis and compare groups of customers over periods of time.

Indicators are everywhere. In an enterprise software company, quarterly
new product bookings are a lagging metric of sales success. By contrast,
new qualified leads are a leading indicator, because they let you predict sales
success ahead of time. But as anyone who’s ever worked in B2B (businessto-business) sales will tell you, in addition to qualified leads you need a
good understanding of conversion rate and sales-cycle length. Only then
can you make a realistic estimate of how much new business you’ll book.

In some cases, a lagging metric for one group within a company is a
leading metric for another. For example, we know that the number of
quarterly bookings is a lagging metric for salespeople (the contracts are
signed already), but for the finance department that’s focused on collecting payment, they're leading indicator of expected revenue (since the revenue hasn't yet been realized).

Ultimately, you need to decide whether the thing you’re tracking helps
you make better decisions sooner. As we’ve said, a real metric has to be
actionable. Lagging and leading metrics can both be actionable, but leading
indicators show you what will happen, reducing your cycle time and making
you leaner.
